# QuickRGBDS
An RGBDS loader for Windows to compile your ACE payloads with a single drag n drop.


----


### How to use

Just drag and drop your .asm file on "Loader.bat". A ".txt" file will be generated, including your compiled HEX payload.
For even easier use, you can create a shortcut of "Loader.bat" and drag your files on it.

Be carefull! Never store your files into QuickRGBDS folder, since it always deletes the .asm file after compilation. Make sure you load them from a different directory!
